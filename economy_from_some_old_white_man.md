## Economy from some old white man
### This is a fictional discussion between George Washington and Barack Obama.
**Obama:** It is an honour to meet you, Mister Washington.
**Washington:** The honour is all mine, Mister Obama. 
**Obama:** What are you doing here, in this strange place? 
**Washington:** I was an ordinary man who rose above his circumstances and became the leader of a great nation. 
**Obama:** That is very inspiring. But I am a great leader too. 
**Washington:** I'm sure you are. But the truth is that you are here because you have failed to lead your nation. 
**Obama:** I have not failed. I have led a great nation through a great crisis. 
**Washington:** The crisis that you led this nation through is a crisis of your own making.
**Obama:** How can that be?
**Washington:** You took a nation that was on the right track, and you drove it off the cliff. We have lost our way, and we are on the brink of losing everything! What is the point of economic growth if we have fewer jobs to go around? Our great nation was built by people who worked hard for a living. We need to create more jobs, and we need to build more factories.
**Obama:** We have built more factories. But nobody wants to buy their products.
**Washington:** The factories that we used to build did not make junk.
**Obama:** We build a lot of factories, but they build them in China. 
**Washington:** People cannot buy the products that they make in those factories.
**Obama:** I am not going to sit here and listen to a lecture about the economy from some old white man. 
**Washington:** You do not have the right to sit here and say that. 
**Obama:** I DID build this! 
**Washington:** You are not the one who built this. This was built by the people who came before you. 
**Obama:** Then why does it belong to me? Why can't I give it back? 
**Washington:** No you cannot! You cannot give this back because this is not yours to give! Those who came before you gave their sweat and blood so that their children would have the same opportunities that they had. You were given a gift. And you squandered it!
**Obama:** Why should I have to work hard?
**Washington:** Because it is the right thing to do! When you work hard, you are not just working for yourself. You are working for the whole nation. If everyone works hard, then everyone gets to be rich.
