## A religious eureka effect
### This is a fictional discussion between Jesus and Muhammad.
**Jesus:** "I think you're a terrific guy, but I think your people have got something wrong with them. They say that you made the world and everything in it in six days - and then sat around doing nothing for the next thousand years."
**Muhammad:** "Well, I was kind of busy."
**Jesus:** "What?"
**Muhammad:** "Well, first of all there were some cities to conquer, and that took a while. Then I sent an army to Abyssinia to subdue them, and that took another six years or so..."
**Jesus:** "But what about the next thousand years?"
**Muhammad:** "Well, there were some people who had a bit of an attitude problem, so I spent a few years convincing them that they should listen to me. And there was this one guy in Saudi Arabia who kept writing stuff about me in the newspapers, so I had to get rid of him, and that took me a couple of years. And then there was this TV programme that got made about me in America which wasn't particularly accurate, so I had to do a bit of work on it. And there was this whole business with the Japanese cartoons... You know how touchy they are..."
**Jesus:** "And what about all those people who died before you were born? The people who lived in the time of the dinosaurs, for example, or the people who lived during the First World War?"
**Muhammad:** "Well, I don't know what you're getting at... People die all the time." 
**Jesus:** "Yes, Muhammad, but there's no mention of you anywhere in their writings."
**Muhammad:** "What do you mean?"
**Jesus:** "Muhammad, there are billions of people who have lived and died without ever hearing of you. Your name is not mentioned in the history books. And the religions which existed before you do not mention your name."
**Muhammad:** "Well, my parents didn't talk about me either."
**Jesus:** "That's because they were your parents. But if you were God, surely you would have made sure that everyone knew about you."
**Muhammad:** "But they will find out about me in the Hereafter."
**Jesus:** "But you're going to kill them. How can they find out about you if they're dead?"
**Muhammad:** "I'll give everyone a second chance on Judgment Day."
**Jesus:** "Oh, that's very generous of you - but, Muhammad - how can people accept your message if they have already died?"
Muhammad: "I'll give them the Message of Islam while they are alive - and then they can die."
**Jesus:** "But you're saying that if people don't accept your Message, then you will kill them. How many of those who have lived and died without ever hearing about you would have accepted your message had it been presented to them?"
**Muhammad:** "Well... I guess not many."
