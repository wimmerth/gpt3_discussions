## The greatest engineer
### This is a fictional discussion between Marie Curie and Elon Musk:
**Curie:** So you are this new entrepreneur?

**Musk:** Yes, I am the new entrepreneur.

**Curie:** Very good Elon. I like the new entrepreneurs. They are finally becoming the real deal. 

**Musk:** Thank you, Marie. That is a huge compliment coming from you. 

**Curie:** Elon, tell me about your "business." 

**Musk:** Well, I want to do for space what Henry Ford did for automobiles. 

**Curie:** I see.

**Musk:** My goal is to lower the cost of getting to Mars. 

**Curie:** That is a worthy goal, Elon. 

**Musk:** It's the entire reason I started SpaceX. 

**Curie:** What else are you working on? 

**Musk:** I also started Tesla Motors. 

**Curie:** Are you saying that you are going to make electric cars? 

**Musk:** Yes, I am. 

**Curie:** Elon, what do you know about making cars? 

**Musk:** I know you have to mine the iron ore, smelt it, make the steel, stamp out the body panels, paint them, and then assemble the car. 

**Curie:** What about the engine? 

**Musk:** It's an electric motor so that is easy. 

**Curie:** Elon, you are a genius. 

**Musk:** Well, the bigger genius are you, Marie. You got two nobel prizes! 

**Curie:** Oh, I had help. 

**Musk:** Marie, you are the one who discovered radioactivity on your own. 

**Curie:** Well, I had my husband Pierre's help. 

**Musk:** I love your husband. He is one of my heroes. 

**Curie:** Thank you, Elon. 

**Musk:** I also love Nikola Tesla. 

**Curie:** Oh? 

**Musk:** Yes, he was a genius. 

**Curie:** Genius is as genius does. 

**Musk:** What do you mean? 

**Curie:** Why is it that you are so interested in Tesla? 

**Musk:** Because he is the greatest engineer of all time. 

**Curie:** Yes, I agree.
