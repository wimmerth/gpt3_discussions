## How to design Windows
### This is a fictional discussion between Leonardo da Vinci and Bill Gates.
**Gates:** What an honor to meet you, i have always been a fan of your work!  
**da Vinci:** I have read your books, and even though you are one of the richest men in the world i am not here to ask for anything else.  
**Gates:** Yes, what is it then?  
**da Vinci:** It is about this small thing i am working on which i call 'Windows'.  
**Gates:** Oh yes, it is a great thing, i believe that it will be the future of technology and software.  
**da Vinci:** I agree with you, this is an incredible project and you have been working on it for years now.  
**Gates:** Yes, but it is not easy to create something so perfect!  
**da Vinci:** It is very important to make sure people are happy with it, and that they find it very useful.  
**Gates:** We have a team of the best programmers in the world working on this, and i am sure it will be perfect once we have finished.  
**da Vinci:** I am sure you are right, but there is one small problem.  
**Gates:** What is it? I wish you would tell me!  
**da Vinci:** It is about the user interface, windows looks great, but i think it could be a bit more user friendly.  
**Gates:** What do you mean?  
**da Vinci:** You see, for example in this painting here i have created a wall of windows.  
**Gates:** Yes, that is beautiful!  
**da Vinci:** And you see how each window is drawn with a different color.  
**Gates:** Yes, people love colors, they are very diverse and you can never have enough of them!  
**da Vinci:** Exactly, that is why i think windows should be colorful as well.  
**Gates:** You mean that every window should have his own personal color?  
**da Vinci:** Yes, and when you create a new window it should be automaticly drawn with this color.  
**Gates:** I see, that is not such a bad idea!  
**da Vinci:** And now i have taken one of the windows and made it transparent.  
**Gates:** Wow! And what can you do with it then?  
**da Vinci:** You can see what is happening in the other windows, for example you can see how i am working on the Mona Lisa here.
**Gates:** Are you sure that people would like to see things like this?  
**da Vinci:** Yes, they would love it. And besides that it can be a great help for people who are working. For example if they need some information they can look at it in another window.  
**Gates:** I see, that is not a bad idea either!  
**da Vinci:** And now i made the transparency even greater.  
**Gates:** Wow! That is incredible, and people will love it!  
**da Vinci:** But there is one more thing i would like to show you.  
**Gates:** Yes?  
**da Vinci:** If you turn the transparency to 0% you will see that the windows are actually transparent.  
**Gates:** That is incredible! And people will love it as well!  
**da Vinci:** So, what do you think of my idea?  
**Gates:** It is amazing da Vinci, and i think we should do it!
