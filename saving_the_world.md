## Saving the world
### This is a fictional discussion between Martin Luther King and Greta Thunberg.
**King:** Good evening, young lady! What do you want?
**Thunberg:** I want the world to be saved from climate change, and I am going to do everything in my power to make that happen!
**King:** That sounds like a very noble thing. But how are you going to do it?
**Thunberg:** King, we have tried all peaceful means for decades. We have written letters and signed petitions, talked with friends and family, planned protests and demonstrations…
**King:** All noble actions.
**Thunberg:** But nothing changes! All the politicians in Europe and America are still working to increase fossil fuel extraction, and they do their best to ignore us. They say we are too young to understand what is going on, even though I am only 16 years old…
**King:** You have my sympathies for your troubles, but unfortunately I don't have a solution. How do you think we can solve climate change?
**Thunberg:** I don't know, but I know that the adults are not doing anything about it. We have tried everything, and nothing works! So now it is time for radical action. It is time to take to the streets and raise our voices as loud as possible. It is time to make ourselves heard!
**King:** Ah, you mean like this?
**Thunberg:** Yes, like this! I can't do anything else. If I have to, I will continue my strike for years and years until the politicians understand that we won't let them destroy our future.
**King:** But Greta, you are just one person. What can you achieve?
**Thunberg:** One person can achieve great things if they stand up for what is right! It is time to make a stand. When I started school, I didn't know anything about climate change, but now it has become my calling in life. I have not eaten a single bite of food for weeks – only drinking water and tea with lemon – so that you can hear me better. You must understand that we will never give up until our demands are met! If they don't listen to us, then they will listen to the oceans rising around them. If they don't listen to the oceans, then they will listen to the birds that disappear from our skies. And if they don't listen to the birds…
**King:** I understand.
**Thunberg:** So you agree with me? You will do everything you can to prevent catastrophic climate change?
**King:** No, I will not. Because climate change is not the problem we face today. Climate change is a symptom of our greatest problem.
When I was your age, I too went on strike for the right cause. There were people who told me that my fight was useless, that we must wait until there is change in Washington and Westminster, but I knew better. You see Greta, if you have a dream of a better world, then you need to help make it happen yourself – not just wait for others to do it.
When I started my fight for civil rights, I was a young man like you. I knew that change only happens when people take a stand, and not wait for someone else to do it for them. Now this is your time to make a difference, Greta!
**Thunberg:** But how can we make change happen? How can we get the politicians to listen to us?
**King:** You can't expect politicians to change their minds. That is not how politics works. They are in the business of getting votes, and they will never take a stand that might be unpopular with their voters.
**Thunberg:** So what do we do?
**King:** Be the change you want to see in the world! If you really want your demands met, then you have to do it yourself. Teach others about climate change, and convince them that you are right.
