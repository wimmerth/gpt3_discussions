## A party in Rome
### This is a fictional discussion between Ed Sheeran and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.
**Palestrina:** Good morning, Ed. What are you doing these days?

**Sheeran:** Well, recently I have been working on a new album.

**Palestrina:** What about?

**Sheeran:** I'm not sure yet. I haven't really thought about it. I just want to make some music.

**Palestrina:** And how is it going so far?

**Sheeran:** I think I've written about five songs, all of which are in different styles.

**Palestrina:** That's a bold move, Ed.

**Sheeran:** I know, right? I'm such a rebel.

**Palestrina:** I'm sure your fans will not be disappointed. I'm sure they'll like whatever you do.

**Sheeran:** Thank you, maestro. That is very kind of you.

**Palestrina:** Do you remember when we first met?

**Sheeran:** Of course! How could I forget?

**Palestrina:** It was at a party in Rome, wasn't it?

**Sheeran:** Yes, it was.

**Palestrina:** You were wearing those weird leather pants.

**Sheeran:** Those weren't weird. They were cool.

**Palestrina:** I'm afraid I didn't notice your pants.

**Sheeran:** Oh, I see.

**Palestrina:** No, I noticed you.

**Sheeran:** That's great.

**Palestrina:** I remember I was sitting on a couch and I started playing the organ.

**Sheeran:** Yes, you were playing "Viderunt Omnes" from your Missa Brevis.

**Palestrina:** I was playing away and I suddenly noticed that you were singing along with me.

**Sheeran:** That's right, I was singing "Viderunt omnes" along with you.

**Palestrina:** Singing "Viderunt omnes" along with me.

**Sheeran:** Singing "Viderunt omnes" along with you.
