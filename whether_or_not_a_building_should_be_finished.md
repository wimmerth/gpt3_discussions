## Whether or not a building should be finished
### This is a fictional discussion between Frank Lloyd Wright and Bjarke Ingels.
**Wright:** Simplicity and repose are the qualities that measure the true value of any work of art. Do you agree?
**Ingels:** What about the work of art that is never finished? The art that is always in the process of becoming something else?
**Wright:** I am talking about the art of making. It is finished when it is finished.
**Ingels:** It is finished when it is finished? But what if a building is never finished? What if it is still in the process of becoming?
**Wright:** It is finished when it is finished!
**Ingels:** But what if it is never finished?
**Wright:** Why not just leave a building alone? Why do you feel the need to finish it?
**Ingels:** I have never left a building alone. I would never leave a building alone. I like to finish a building. We are in the process of finishing the building that I have been working on for the last six years. It is never finished. I don't want it to be finished.
**Wright:** I can see that you are still in the process of finishing this building.
**Ingels:** It is a big building. It is a big process.
**Wright:** I can see that you are still in the process of finishing this building.
**Ingels:** You see that the building is still under construction. That's what I wanted.
**Wright:** You wanted it to be unfinished. You wanted it to be unfinished?
**Ingels:** The building is never finished.
