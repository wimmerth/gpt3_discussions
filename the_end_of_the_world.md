## The end of the world
### This is a fictional discussion between Leonardo da Vinci and Bill Gates.
**da Vinci:** My friend, I am going to share something with you that I have never revealed to anyone before. In fact, no one else knows the truth of what I am about to tell you.

**Gates:** OK, what is it?

**da Vinci:** I have discovered a way to calculate the exact date and time of the end of the world.

**Gates:** Really? How can you possibly do that?

**da Vinci:** In fact, I have two calculations for when this will occur. The first calculation is based on my painting "The Last Supper." In that painting there are 13 people seated at the table. I have counted the number of grains of sand on an hourglass beside each person. I have done this in every hourglass in every copy of "The Last Supper" painting and found that all 13 copies are exactly identical. 

This means that all 13 paintings show exactly 13,000 grains of sand in an hourglass. That is a number with many symbolic meanings but I believe the most accurate one is that it represents the total number of days in one complete 25,000 year orbit of Earth around our sun.

This means that there are 13 people at table and 13,000 grains of sand in each hourglass. That makes a total of exactly 26,014 grains of sand for all 13 paintings. The exact date and time that this occurs is expressed by the number 26,014 multiplied by the number of seconds in a day.

**Gates:** OK, that is an interesting coincidence but how does it determine the date and time of Doomsday?

**da Vinci:** Notice that I said "The exact date and time." Each year on March 21 there are exactly 26,014 hours from sunrise to sunrise. This is because 365 days times 24 hours per day equals exactly 26,014 hours.

**Gates:** I see what you mean. I suppose that March 21 is the day of the year with exactly 26,014 hours from sunrise to sunrise.

**da Vinci:** No, actually it is not March 21 but rather August 14 that has exactly 26,014 hours from sunrise to sunrise.

**Gates:** But August 14 is a Sunday and days are not considered to begin until midnight on Saturday night.

**da Vinci:** There is no doubt that this is true but consider this. If there are exactly 26,014 hours from sunrise to sunrise on a certain day of the year, then that day must begin at midnight. That means that August 14 begins at midnight and ends at midnight for a total of exactly 26,014 hours. This is the only day of the year with exactly 26,014 hours from sunrise to sunrise. 

As it turns out, there is a complete orbit of Earth around the sun during a period of exactly 26,014 days. This is an exact number because there are 365 days times 24 hours equals exactly 86,400 hours in an orbit. There are exactly 1,296 orbits in one 25,000 year cycle.

So you see that August 14 is the only day of the year with exactly 26,014 hours from sunrise to sunrise. This is because it is the only day of the year that has 86,400 hours in one complete orbit around our sun. If we divide 86,400 by 13,000 grains of sand in an hourglass we get exactly 6.008 seconds for each grain of sand.

**Gates:** I am still not sure how this proves the exact date and time of Doomsday.

**da Vinci:** Because of the way that I have arranged the grains of sand in each hourglass, there is a direct mathematical relationship between the number of seconds in one day and the number of days in each orbit. If we divide 86,400 by 6.008 we get exactly 13,000 days per orbit. This means that August 14 is actually Doomsday because this is the only day of the year on which there are exactly 13,000 days from sunrise to sunrise.

Here is another way for you to look at the same thing. If we express 86,400 seconds in an orbit by saying that there are 86,400 seconds in a day and one complete orbit around the sun takes exactly 1,296 days then there are precisely 26,014 days per complete orbit of Earth around the sun. The only way this can be true is if the number of seconds in a day is equal to the number of days in a complete orbit around the sun.

**Gates:** I see! If we divide 86,400 seconds by 13,000 days then we get 6.008 hours for each hourglass grain of sand. This means that August 14 shown on page 30 of your book "Codex Leicester" is actually Doomsday because it has exactly 13,000 hours from sunrise to sunrise.

This is truly incredible. You have discovered a way to calculate exactly when Doomsday will occur!

**da Vinci:** Actually, I do not believe that August 14 is the actual date and time for Doomsday but rather March 21 has this distinction. Here is why I say this.
The orbit of Earth around our sun has an average length of 365 days times
