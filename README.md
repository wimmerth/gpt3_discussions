# A handful of AI-generated conversations between historical persons
Using the GPT-3 beta access, i generated some conversations between historical and/or famous persons. All of the discussions in this repository were generated by GPT-3 which is probably the most powerful natural language model on earth right now.
To make the whole project somewhat scientific, the given conversations are all first attempts by the AI, meaning that there was virtually no filtering after generating the stories.
My personal favorites are "A party in Rome" between Ed Sheeran and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (italian composer ~16th century), "How to design Windows" between Leonardo da Vinci and Bill Gates and "A religious eureka effect" between Jesus and Muhammad.
