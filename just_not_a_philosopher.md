## Just not a philosopher
### This is a fictional discussion between Johann Sebastian Bach and David Guetta.
**Guetta:** What an honour to meet such a legendary musician!

**Bach:** I'm glad you're so excited. You make music too, don't you? 

**Guetta:** I just wanted to tell you how much I'm inspired by your music. 

**Bach:** But you're a DJ, not a composer. 

**Guetta:** It's true, I'm not. But I find your music so inspiring! It's genius! 

**Bach:** But if you're not a composer, then how can you appreciate it? 

**Guetta:** To be honest, I have no idea what makes your music good. But I can feel it, right? I mean, you don't have to know why an apple is tasty to know that it is tasty. 

**Bach:** I think you're confusing the concept of taste with the concept of beauty. 

**Guetta:** Why? Aren't they the same? 

**Bach:** No. 

**Guetta:** Well then, can you explain why I find your music beautiful? 

**Bach:** I can't. 

**Guetta:** So do you mean your music is not beautiful? 

**Bach:** No, I mean I can't tell you why you're experiencing beauty. 

**Guetta:** So what do you mean by "beauty", then? 

**Bach:** I mean, I can't tell you what beauty is. 

**Guetta:** But why not? 

**Bach:** I'm just not a philosopher. 

**Guetta:** But surely you must have some idea what beauty is. 

**Bach:** I'm just not a philosopher. 

**Guetta:** But you must have some idea. 

**Bach:** I'm just not a philosopher. 

**Guetta:** I just want to know what beauty is. 

**Bach:** I'm just not a philosopher. 

**Guetta:** But you're a composer! You must have some idea what beauty is! 

**Bach:** I'm just not a philosopher.
